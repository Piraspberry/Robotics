I did get re-booked on a 5:40 am flight the next morning by an agent on the phone but the gentleman next to me was having problems as he had the united basic economy ticket and she was not being very accommodating. at that point I stated I didn't feel that was right since it was united's ""fault"" for the delay and since he had the basic economy ticket couldn't do much. at that point she turned to me, and obviously not liking my comment stated she was not helping me and it was not my problem. and when the gentleman stated so it's your fault the plane isn't here she replied, no it's not my fault. she was obviously NOT dealing well with confrontation and did not give a good reflection on how the situation should have been handled. the other gentleman was very upset as he purchased his ticket not on united's website and said there was nothing really stating of the restrictions/limitations with purchasing the basic economy ticket. he finally did have to talk with a manager then to find any resolve. I experienced the same exact situation in november 2017 on the same flight from San Diego to Madison where the flight back (Madison to Chicago) had problems so people needed to be re-booked. I never found out the reasons why that time but in any situation like this one, if it would be united's ""fault"" for the delay-you know what you do what you can to accommodate a passenger. so whether they have whatever ticket with united, you should do whatever it takes to get that passenger to their final destination. I know the gentleman was very upset and said he would never fly united again. personally I will also look at other airlines when I have to fly back to Madison again in 5 months. I do not like how united has created this ""cheaper"" ticket ""level"" which limits the passenger a lot including not being able to choose a seat, not being able to bring a carry on, limited options on rebooking to name a few. and it's not cheaper-you just created another level to charge the customer more. this year with everything added together my round trip ticket to Madison WI from San Diego was basically $600! I had been pricing tickets probably 4-5 months prior waiting for prices to come down and they never did-so I am not sure why I kept hearing ticket prices were down this year-time you add on all the extra fees you have to pay now...I have never had to pay so much for a ticket before. (I'm digressing however). and personally I did pay extra for my ticket only later to find out 1.) the flight from Madison to Chicago somehow got to Madison and took off and completed the trip in half the scheduled time so if I would have actually taken that flight chances are I probably would have made my connection (why and how I even got rebooked then is confusing to me). instead I now got re-booked on a 5:40 am flight which means having to get up at 3 am (as well as my 80 year old parents) to get to the airport on time to check luggage etc. so my day I am supposed to",Negative,-0.991

I was traveling alone with an infant and had a car seat base to check, rather than politely informing what to do or simply helping me do it as the attendant did from LAX to ORD, she rudely ignored me when I tried handing the item to her. Then when I mentioned I needed to check the item, she snotily replied You need to check it at the kiosk. I said I tried but it wasn’t clear how to do it. Again, with an attitude she told me to go to the kiosk and ask the man that was standing there. It’s frustrating and makes a person anxious enough traveling alone with a 4month old but to be tested so rudely right at the beginning of a trip makes it that much harder and stressful. I’d also like to mention that because I purchased, and have in the past, a seat for my infant I knew their car seat needed to be placed in a seat by the window. However, other passengers do not realize this all the time. If I’m purchasing a ticket for an infant their seat when checking in should automatically be selected as a window seat rather than whatever two seats the computer may select because this creates unnecessary friction when I, as a passenger, have to inform another passenger that I have taken their seat because this is where the car seat is required to go.

I have reached out to TSA pre-check, but who (i) were very helpful and knowledgeable and (ii) despite not being able to get basic information from United (see the hour and a half experience above), are investigating to determine what the problem could have been.  The flight itself was fine but the TSA lines at Newark were long and it took ~45 minutes (not United's responsibility).  I am very frustrated with the inability to have basic questions answered by the United team - i.e. no one seemed to have access to determine now my full name was input into the system (tied to my mileage plus number) and what, if any, passport number was tied to my account.

I finally found the way to Assistance. At the EWR UA assistance, we got assigned to UA 179 the next day. My parents speak only Cantonese and the assistant James Germany told us we could sit together and just the system didn’t allow him to choose the seats properly. He told us with confidence that we could be sitting together.     We are assigned flights 24 hours after but we are only given USD 10 per person. Who could survive on usd 10 for a day????

I was traveling with my husband 2.5 year old son, and infant. We purchased three seats. From the moment we arrived in Newark to check in for our flight to Boston, we had a bad experience. A very busy day (new years day) at the airport and there was only one representative to assist with kiosk check in. We had an infant and a car seat to check, which automatically requires assistance from a United Airlines representative. We waited a very long time. As my husband was working on getting tickets and the car seat tag from the kiosk, I waited in the baggage line.  The representative behind the counter immediately accused us of cutting the line. She did not say hello - just yelled at us. It was very poor customer service, accusatory, and wrong.  She was relentless and didn't believe that I had waited in line.   We arrived on the plane and discovered that someone had vomited in our seats prior to our arrival. This must have happened on the previous flight. The smell was sickening and there was throw up everywhere - pieces on the seat belt, front of the seats, top of the seat. I flagged down a flight attendant who barely acknowledged me and finally came over after about 10 minutes. Yes, it was busy, but this was a bit of an urgent situation and I was being extremely patient and polite. When she approached us, she immediately was accusatory. She did  not say hello or what can I help with, she immediately said - you are not supposed to be sitting here. We were shocked and confused as those were our seats. She was extremely rude. She did not have her information correct and acknowledged that after about a minute, but what a horrible way to start a conversation especially considering the disgusting situation we were dealing with in the seats. The flight attendant arranged for the cleaning crew to come on board as we stood for 20 minutes in the aisle with our two young kids waiting. The cleaning crew replaced the seat cover, seat belt and wiped down the area. Great. But, we discovered this wasn't sufficient as all of our bags that were on the floor smelled terribly of vomit.  We arrived home and threw away our bags and clothing since it had been soaking up someone else's vile.   I still remain shocked by the two accusatory situations we were in -  for absolutely no reason. A very calm and polite family with well behaved children who was doing everything correctly. I am upset that there was no apology for the seat situation and that this was not recognized prior to us boarding. This is a health issue and I am concerned that my family has now contracted norovirus.   I look forward to speaking with someone about this matter.

He received that suitcase and was excited to use it on this trip to Chicago.  When we got back to DC and received the bags he noticed that his brand new suitcase had been damaged in numerous places.  These were not mere scratches or smudges, but damage to the seams that exposed the wire underneath in three different places and damage to one of the zippers that will result in it needing to be replaced. We immediately took the bag to the United desk to file a claim.  We were informed that because the damage did not prevent the bag from holding luggage, United would do nothing to repair the bag.  My son is very disappointed.  And as a senior leader at a multi-billion company, I'm embarrassed that any company (let alone one of the largest airlines in the world) would risk losing a customer over a torn $100 bag.     I should note that I am a fairly regular United flier, but my experience the with United in 2017 has been miserable.  This trip was no different.  Prior to leaving for Chicago, I discovered that United had bumped all five members of my party and we had no seats, despite having made reservations months in advance.  I called and luckily we were able to secure our original seats on the flight out.  For the return flight (this flight) we were not able to do that and we forced to selected seats near the rear of the plane.  When we boarded the plane, I noticed that our original seats were listed on the display in blue, meaning that they were empty.  Running an airline is a logistical nightmare.  I get there will be bumps.  But my past year with United has been miserable.  This flight was the icing on a really bad year.  I hope it will get better.",Negative,-0.8978

The first woman I spoke with at the customer care desk told me my bag was scanned at LAX and would be appearing on the belt in about 10 minutes. I waited 30 and nothing came out. I then went to the 2nd woman at customer care and after many questions was finally told my luggage was sent on the wrong flight (#275). Since that flight did not have a gate to pull up to, I was advised to arrange for my bag to be sent to me free of charge. I was given a file # and 800 # and was told I would receive a call later that evening once my bag had arrived. I never received a call, but did get an email from WheresMyLuggage.com.   It is now 3 days later and I have yet to receive my baggage, details of its whereabouts, or an explanation of what happened. Each time I call the baggage call center, the representatives either tell me my bag will arrive ""within 2 hours"", or that the 3rd party delivery company ""is not answering their phone"".  The supervisors in this department are always busy. The last two representatives I spoke with became very rude when I insisted on speaking with a supervisor... the last gentleman outright refused to pass my call along, saying the supervisor would just give me the same answer.   I have now missed 3 days of work waiting for my baggage to be delivered and am told I will not be compensated for my time or the lost bag until I receive the bag. I have always been a loyal United traveler and my family and I have always chosen United over other airlines, but I am utterly disgusted with the way United is handling this situation. As retail director of a luxury fashion house, I understand things happen out of our control. But United's handling of this situation turned an unfortunate incident into a customer service nightmare. Why was I not notified when I arrived at LAX that my bag had been put on the wrong flight? Why have I not received a straight answer from anyone regarding the location of my bag? And finally, if this 3rd party delivery company is so unreliable and so unprofessional as to not answer their phones, why does United continue to contract with them?

We ended up sitting in two sets of two. Not convenient.  2. My kids became unaccompanied minors in the United system which caused a number of issues, including an extended check-in process that could not be done on-line 3. The rest of my family lost their group 1 status - not a big issue, just annoying 4. Part of my family lost their pre-check status  I specifically declined the upgrade option to avoid this.

They then made an announcement--in Spanish only (even though almost all the flyers were American).  They said it would be 15 minutes and they would have more information.  An hour later, we still had not had another announcement on what was going on. Very poor communication on the part of the gate staff.

After calling my doctor and asking for a letter, having him call me back for details and interupting his busy day, he types up a letter on his lunch hour and e-mails it to me. I send it to accessibilities, but it's declined. I am very frustrated and upset with this department and pay the $125 for my dog to travel. I ask the department to send me exactly what I needed in the letter so that my dog can fly back with me in a couple of weeks. The woman says she will, but the e-mail never comes. I call back again today, the day after flying, and complain and insist on the letter be sent today. The woman says that she will send it, SHE NEVER DOES!!!  THIS IS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I AM SO UPSET WITH YOUR COMPANY!!!  Please respond to this complaint with an explanation. My e-mail address is Buzzboy236@aol.com. I expect a prompt response.",Negative,-0.9807

We then tried to check-in at the same kiosk and scale and had the same problem of still over, so we got back out of line, rummaged thru our suitcases again and removed another lightweight item or two from each case. We then went to a different kiosk and scale for the third time and found out we were both significantly under on weight. It would have to be impossible for what we removed to make  that big a difference in the poundage. It was very frustrating and disappointing that the delays took so much time we had to rush to the gate and have no opportunity to grab a bite before boarding for our departure. I wonder how many other passengers might have been affected by an inaccurate scale.",Negative,-0.8969

When I informed her that bag for within the guidelines of a personal item, and even when I fit it completely inside the measuring device beside where we were standing, she still insisted it was too big!

Also included is the reservation and mileage plus call center. I have expectations as a customer and these experiences meet if not exceed my expectations.  However, the customer service experience on my flights is inconsistent, especially this one in particular. I obeserved the multiple customers ask what was in the meal, and one of the flight attendants said “I don’t know, I just read what it is. They don’t inform what’s in it.” She proceeded to open the meal there and said what was in it.  I’m glad people asked ahead of me, since I have multiple food allergies. (Soft suggestion, ANA offers a 27-allergy free meal, if this possible for United to offer? I certainly do not want to use my epi-pen on flight and rushed to the emergency room upon landing.) Another observation, is they came through the aisle with the drink cart. Afterwards, a customer asked for a ginger-ale and the flight attendant responded frustrated, “We just came through with drinks but I’ll bring it.” Lastly, when I went to the back with my water bottle, I asked if it could be filled. The flight attendant would only fill it half way. This gave me the perception that water supply is limited on the flight.

I arrived at 9 p.m. the gate for a red eye flight scheduled for 11 p.m. I was seated a few feet away from the gate check in desk. I was assigned group 3. They started boarding group 1 and 2 and said that group three should stay seated. As I was extremely tired, I apparently was overcome by sleep and woke up after the boarding was completed. I rushed to the desk, and the agents yelled at me because it was 11 minutes before the flight. They said they paged me overhead, which I of course did not hear. Instead of coming to wake me up, or expressing any sympathy with how tired I was, they rebuked me, and said they had to check in my carry-on, which was an extremely small piece that usually fits under the seat in front of me. My seat was 8 F, but for some reason, they had changed it to 19 F. Every time I said something about the seat or the carry-on, they would say, then do not get on this flight and we will put you on the next flight. I did get on the flight but the 19 F seat is so squashed that it was even difficult to get to it. When I asked the flight attendant to give me my original seat, she called the agent. Another very rude agent came and kept saying you either sit here or we deplane you and put you on the next flight. Finally, I asked her to ask the person in seat 8 F how he or she got the seat. She would not do that, but a hostess did, and that person gave me my original seat back. The agent kept telling me to complain on line. I told her what good will it do me to complain after I suffer for 4 hours. She just kept saying I will put you on the next plane. I had been at a conference in Ventura county and had another conference in Chicago at 7 a.m. therefore there was no way for me to miss this flight and be placed on another flight, plus there was no reason for them to keep threatening me with this since I had an expensive ticket and had done nothing that necessitated such disrespectful and threatening treatment. I always fly Delta and try to avoid flying United or American because of such treatment that these airlines have become known for.

I have been trying to get my frequent flyer miles onto this flight for over a week.  Twice I have called to put the number on, and twice they told me it worked.  But when I got to the airport, it was not on the reservation.  The woman at bag drop off was downright snotty about trying to fix it for me, telling me that I could check online.  But why would I check on line when a SECOND agent at Mileage Plus told me it was fine?  Am I just supposed to never believe an agent on the phone when they tell me they have accomplished what I called about?  At the gate, the agent was much nicer, and she tried to put the number on for me, and apparently another agent tried to help her over the phone.  But I still need to call, now a THIRD time, not including the help I tried to get at the airport for the problem.  Another issue is that this was a basic economy ticket, which is a terrible idea and you should discontinue it.  My employer only allows the ""basic"" ticket, so if I fly for work and want to fly United, I will have to do this kind of ticket.  But it's ridiculous to not get a carry on (which might or might not be waived if you have a Mileage Plus credit card, but it isn't clear which ones are ""qualifying,"" and I couldn't get the Mileage number onto the card, as detailed above, so I didn't know whether that would be waived or not).  In addition, having no seat makes you feel as if you are flying standby, which is not viable when traveling for business.  It certainly can NOT save United time or money to have to have the agent find you a seat at the gate - that is completely counter to the automation you have turned to to save money.    Anyway, the flight was okay, even though I had a middle seat.  But the service in terms of the Mileage Plus number, including the agent at check in has been appalling -- I'm told one thing, but it's just not true.  And again, the Basic Economy is terrible, and if you leave this as an option, I will have no option but to stop flying United for business -- and I probably fly at least once a month for work.",Negative,-0.8781

Not as a regular traveler, definitely not as a prestige loyalty member of he airline. I was politely asking for something and got a very humiliating response.

The staff who handled my and my companion's check-in was very rude and unprofessional - which, in my opinion, does not at all live up to a United Airline staff's standard.  Here is what happened:  As a silver member who fly with UA since 2009, my understanding about the check-in policy is that both me and my companion can have the ""priority"" tags on our check-in luggages, even though my companion is just a frequent flyer.  In fact, for all the trips we travelled together using UA services (in 2016 & 2017), this has always been the case, whereby both of us have the ""priority"" tag for our check-in luggages.   However, while we were checking in at Beijing Airport on 1/11 (aisle D at D05 desk), the guy who handled our check-in refused to put the ""priority"" tag on my companion's luggage, even though I explained the UA policy to him when my companion found that he didn't apply the ""priority"" tag on the luggage (I booked the airline tickets for both of us and we are under the same confirmation number).  Instead of handling this issue in a professional and polite way, the staff refuses to acknowledge his mistake until I talked with his supervisor and showed both of them my confirmation number.  Even then, he wouldn't apologize for his mistake and still insisted that he was right.  The way how he handled the situation was unaccepted and doesn't live up to the standard as a UA staff.  This is the first time I encountered a UA staff who was really rude and unprofessional.  I am just hoping that, the company should strengthen the training to all staff (particularly staff outside of US) so that they are all familiar with the policy and minimize the number of mistakes they might make in this regard.

My first flight was from Newark to LAX. Check in at Newark was very upsetting. My suitcase was 4 pounds overweight. I asked a leader (Tyrone C - Cooly? I can’t remember his last name) from United if he could waive the fee. He was very unfriendly with his response - no. I explained my mum had just died and this trip was costing me money that I did not have. I have flown to Australia 3 times in the last 6 months because my mum has been very sick with cancer. The cost of this totals over $3500 has been a financial stress. I am not a rich person. I had to use my credit cards to pay for them. Yes credit cards - plural. Now my mum is dead. I just wanted to have a little compassion and not have to spend more money than I already had. I understand that your policy is to charge overweight baggage. However, in any situation I believe there can be a degree of flexibility with policy. I know had the option to remove some items and put them in my carry-on. My reluctance to this was because I already had a heavy carry-on backpack, already stuffed full with personal items. Adding another 4 pounds to it is exhausting on my back and my body. Aside from the cost I just wanted to be able to get to Australia as refreshed as possible. Don you know how long it takes to get to Melbourne from New York? It is 90 minutes from my home to Newark airport. It is then 2 hours waiting at the airport to board the plane and take off. It is the 5.5 hours to LA. Then 90 minutes waiting for my next flight to Melbourne. This flight is 15 hours to Melbourne. Once landed it takes about an hour to get through customs and baggage claim. Finally it takes 1 hour to get to my parents house from Melbourne airport. From door to door it took me 26.5 hours to get home. By the time I got there I felt as dead as my mother was.  It was only 4 pounds - not very much in my opinion. When I explained all of this to Tyrone he was very unfriendly. He stated very firmly that it was not possible. When i explained further he began to get agitated with me and very rude and dismissive. I was so shocked at his behavior that I began to get upset. At this point I was more upset about the way he was treating me with such a lack of kindness, concern, and compassion. No one should treat anybody this way. Tyrone needs to be educated in how to interact with people who are experiencing very distressing situations. Compassion should be his first reaction. Not annyoance and anger. I felt so disrespected. I have been a mileageplus member for a few years now. Last year I reached silver status premier access. I feel given that I am a loyal customer I should have a more pleasant experience with your airline. This experience has made me feel that I am not a valued customer. I live in Brooklyn, NY. Newark is very far away to travel to, but I choose United as I wanted to be a loyal customer who can experience the benefits of my patronage and all the money that I pay you. I have had minor unpleasant experiences with United before such as a broken entertainment unit. I was compensated $100 for this experience. Similarly I was compensated $100 when a different flight was compensated. If you offer me $100 compensation for this experience I will be very, very offended. I’m not asking for anything, but if you think $100 would make this extremely shitty experience (while I am already",Negative,-0.9573

Come to find out there was plenty of overhead space. The flight was not full. I carried on for a reason. After we landed I waited to get my bag back and the baggage crew was first being delayed with bringing out the bags because apparently the bag belt was broken and they were waiting for another one. Than I am the last person standing there still waiting for my bag and they shut the door right in front of me. I wait a minute thinking maybe the are going to bring up another bag and nothing. I finally exit to go inside the gate and was informed that maybe the rain in Detroit took the ticket off my bag and that I should go see if my bag made it to the carousel. The woman at the gate should the baggage workers were not looking for it. So myself and my coworker whom is patiently waiting and thinking he was going to be on his way home in our car service by now go to the carousel and my bag is sitting there with the green tag clearly visible and intact.

First of all I didn’t ask her anything about my baggage.  Second she didn’t answer my question and third she had attitude as if I had pissed her off.  My response to her was, that’s not what I asked you about.  I then had to repeat the question because she was not listening with the intent to actually hear.  After I finished printing my luggage tag and while waiting to drop my bags off, I witnessed the other agent working that area being rude and nasty to a couple also checking.  They were several stations down from my location but I could clearly hear the agent in a nasty voice and tone tell them that they have too many bags, they couldn’t carry them on the plane.  The agent was counting and identifying each bag and what it was.  She was speaking so loudly to them that everyone in the area could hear them.  I couldn’t clearly understand or hear what the couple was saying but I could tell they were speaking with a heavy accent.  The United agent should have been speaking in a softer and calmer manner.  No one else should have heard what she was saying especially not others at the other end of the area.  These incidents happened between 3:30 am and 3:45 am in the 12th of January.

Not one flight attendant or pilot arrived until midnight and when they arrived they had said they already flew 8 hours and did not have any hours remaining to fly so the flight was cancelled.   That was terrible and left everyone confused and panicked.  They then sent everyone to the customer service counter, not to mention which is far away from that gate all at one time.  The line was tremendously long and everyone was trying to get out of Houston on the next available flight, whether it was a connecting flight or not to Pittsburgh.  I was at the customer service desk for roughly 1.5 -2 hours going back and forth with the lady at the desk to get me out of Houston and on a flight to or around the Pittsburgh area.  I finally got a connecting flight which took me to Newark at 6am and later to Pittsburgh.  I had to sleep in the airport on the floor And was told they would not do anything for me since the cancellation was weather related.  Keep in mind no pilots showed up until midnight and they had no hours to fly!

Particularly one named Lauren. I was sitting at the back of the plane in an aisle seat. The overhead bin space was very limited back there, but I got some space above my seat kna bin that had a metal shelf blocking part of the space. I was able to fit my luggage and my small backpack and overcoat in the bin, as the aisle doesn't have room under the seat due to the electrical wiring. Around when boarding group 4 came on, a group of men complained that there was no space for their luggage (almost all of the bins were obviously full at this point). And they pointed to my stuff and made crass remarks. Without bothering to ask whose things they were, Lauren explained ""well obviously that has to be changed"", climbed up on the seat arm rests (didn't say excuse me and she was wearing a skirt) and actually grabbed my stuff and threw it to the the side in the bin. Never mind my bag had my corporate laptop and sensitive things that could have been damaged by the metal shelf. I said to her ""ma'am, excuse me but their bags won't fit. There's a metal shelf there blocking most of tbe bin which is why I put my stuff there"". She turns around, sneers at me and says ""yah. I fly this plane a lot more than you do"" and continues to shove my personal effects. Only to turn around , look at their luggage, and realize IT DOeSNT fit"". So she walks on the arm rests to the next row of bins and starts shoving other people's stuff. Only to find that their bags aren't going to fit there either. So she ended up having to hate check and wasted a lot of time. Not only that but she left my stuff strewn in the bin and didn't even have the grace to put it back.  To make it worse, any time I tried to ask for something she treated me with extreme attitude. Until she came to make me pay for my cheese box and saw my Global Services card. Then her attitude changed somewhat. But honestly she shouldn't be treating anyone that way, let alone a global services member who flies enough to know how many bags fit In the bins....  she spent more time standing in tbe back talking about what clubs she was going to when she got home.

However, the real story was their was no crew to fly.  I don't believe that is a true statement.  I was talking to the crew for the Louisville flight while standing in line as we all were waiting for the plane to come in from St. Louis.  When the flight arrived the crew got in to go to Louisville.  However, then things changed.  Someone made the decision to move that crew to the Montreal flight that was also delayed because the original crew ran out of hours.    I am sure that is a financial business decision (and I understand business decisions), however nothing was said except our flight was now delayed to the next morning.  The crew was switched.  Again, I understand but to receive no compensation for a plane/crew change while everyone was in line is not good customer service.  As a Platinum member I find that inexcusable, that at midnite I had to travel to a hotel.  It was perceived (though probably true) that the Montreal passengers were a more lucrative route.

We still stayed at the gate for a good 50 minutes waiting for a maintenance log book that took 45-50 mins for them to drive over from the maintenance area. While it didn't personally affect me other than being late, lots of passengers were complaining that they couldn't ski for their half day they paid for now as we were getting in to late. If you're going to swap make sure it works, but flying to a ski destination should at least consider folks who only vacation every now and then that paid a lot for their flight and just lost out on a 1/2 day skiing.

The staff yes’d us to death rather than take the time to find out the accurate information . The general communication was atrocious. We wasted 45 minutes being shuffled around on those buses, half the staff were speaking Spanish in front of us (some cursing) with no regard as to whether or not we understood them. I understood them, and did enjoy being spoken about in another language. We kept asking to speak to whoever was in charge so we could get accurate information, and no one took responsibility. When we finally found someone in charge, he mildly threatened that the terminal could have been shut down and we should just be happy we were able to fly out. It is clear your staff at the terminal is neither prepared or interested in being prepared for any type of emergency. Considering EWR is a major hub, and considering all the NYC area has been through, one would think that your company would have a handle on disaster preparedness, and something like a transformer fire would amount to another day at work.

First, a very large man was sitting in 7E, I was in 7D. The man could not completely sit in the seat as he actually sat partially atop the arm rests and his bottom never was able to touch the seat. Prior to departure I offered to take the next flight and was told to sit down (rudely) and this was the last flight to Chicago for which we were delayed (like I didn’t know). Please note I was myself I need of wheel chair assistance that I declined upon arrival as I needed to slowly walk due to cramping from the trip. I however was told that there were several open seats in the back of the plane if I wanted to switch after take off. I said thank you. Later in the flight I quietly (away) from my seat inquired about procedures in this situation asking why they didn’t offer him the open seat (with a second open seat next to the one they offered and a retractable armrest) near the back of the plane, I was told it is against the law. By the way partially through flight I decided to move but other passengers had switched seats and that seat was no longer available. Not a comfortable flight. The second issue was that I left my vest in the overhead bin. I noticed that I forgot it after I walked through security. I immediately went to the office near baggage claim, they called the gate, the gate confirmed the had it. I was given a gate pass to go back. The security line was close to 35 minutes long (TSA precheck does not apply for gate passes) I decided to go to UA Pemier checkin. A supervisor called on her radio trying to get a gate attendant, after 20 min of no response she told me to wait where we were and she went to the gate. When she returned no vedt was found and the plane had departed to Mexico. Long story short. Bad day for me. My United mileage plus number is. UBF 66016",Negative,-0.7835

Then we stopped for about 45 minutes with no clear reason why. Then, everyone who had boarded was made to get off the plane. Finally, we received an update that the flight was delayed and we'd resume boarding in 3 hours, at about 8:00pm.   At around 6:45pm, I receive an update that the flight will actually begin boarding at 7pm now. I rush back to the gate, I thought this is great we aren't that delayed now. However, when we arrived at the gate again we had to wait in line for 1 hour and we did not start boarding until 8:15pm!! The update was a lie.   On top of all these delays and constant miscommunication of when our flight was actually boarding, they made the entire plane check their carry on bags. Given that our flight was already delayed by 3 hours, I was more than angry to have to wait an additional 30 minutes in Houston at 11:30pm at night to pick up my bag. I planned ahead with a smaller luggage so that I could avoid this. I did everything on my part to make sure I complied with the rules (liquid sizes, luggage size, etc.) only for United to disregard the planning that this took because of mistakes you made.  My experience with United on Friday evening was completely unprofessional and my opinion of the airline has greatly decreased.

The baggage in question was my daughters and she was getting upset it would not make it on the plane. The agents advised her to take a few things out and put it in a carry-on just in case.  What happened to delayed me 45 minutes in getting to the check in And could not be seated with my daughter. The agent handling the bags were not very communicative or reassuring  while we were going through this.  Someone walked her bag to the handlers because they  did not know how to create a manual ticket for the bag. Upon getting on the plane we asked how to connect the Wi-Fi. The flight attendant then told us that. We had to download the app before loading the plane to be able to get Wi-Fi. So now my anxious daughter who is not sure her  luggage was making it to our trip Had no way to watch movies or take her mind off of it for 4 1/2 hours. The flight attendant said they normally make an announcement before you board the plane but I think there should at least be signs. The delay in the baggage also caused us not to be able to get breakfast because the agents told us we needed to get going and they would handle the bag. We figured we could then order breakfast on the plane.   You were seated in the back of the plane and since both attendance started upfront by the time they reach us after an hour and a half they were out of breakfast.

Also, it seemed like water seeped into the bag and completely ruined a golf towel with black grease and soaked with water.  The explanation for the forgotten baggage ranged from no idea to the snow storm 3 days earlier resulted in no golf bags being loaded with other baggage.  Poor excuses. In your recent flight magazine the header read “the best companies are willing to disrupt themselves in order to remain relevant to customers.”  Based on this recent (and I stress recent) unpleasant and inconvenient experience (cancelled t-time and no golf equipment...no golf bag, no golf clubs, no golf shoes, no golf balls = NO GOLF), it should more appropriately read “companies today are willing to disrupt customers in order to be relevant to themselves.”  The intent of vaca was relaxing and golfing; the experience created extreme stress.

He said I could get on it as it was pulling away from the gate. We waited another 2 hours to get out of the airport as the 10:50am plane had all kinds of issues.

When we arrived in Norfolk, there were a bunch of SKI Bags and other baggage missing. After some time at the Luggage claim, we were told that the missing luggage items were likely still in Chicago. My Ski bag was one left behind. Since there were about 15 people in line to fill out claims, the Baggage clerk handed out slips of info so we could file claims online instead of waiting even longer at the airport. I took a slip, traveled home and tried to file a claim online. There was no place to file online. Turns out I had to call in to a CS Rep to get the Claim started and to receive the ""File Number"". I indicated that I would pickup the bag once it arrived in Norfolk. I also agreed to receive TXT updates about the status. Once the CS Rep opened the claim, I received a TXT confirmation that said I would be updated every 12 hours on the status. The next morning I checked the online status page and it indicated I needed to check back later. Later that day, I checked back again at the status page and it indicated ""Baggage located and arrived at Airport"". A few hours later, I was going to go out to do some errands, and since I had no direct notifications or calls about the luggage, I checked again. The online page still had the same message. I called the phone number to check status and it indicated ""Baggage was located and is en-route to airport"". Since I was unsure, I did not go to airport to try and pickup the item. The next day, I checked both online and via Telephone again and both maintained the same contradictory status info. During the two days, I received no telephone or TXT updates at all. Later in the afternoon on the second day, I called the phone number again and status was the same, ""En route"". I asked to speak to an agent, and finally the agent confirmed the baggage had been delivered to Norfolk Airport at 8:30AM the previous day. Finally, that night, I went and retrieved the bag. This was a pretty poor handling of the missing luggage claim. Yes, it was delivered to Norfolk the very next morning, but the Online and Phone systems provided contradictory status info and no status was directly provided via TXT or phone during that time. this was not a pleasing experience.",Negative,-0.9255

Our original flight was cancelled about 12 hours before its scheduled departure and we were put on other flights, but these were later cancelled due to ""weather"".  Had we been able to fly slightly earlier in the day, we would have made it to our destination on time.  When our replacement flights were cancelled, United hid behind the ""weather"" issues and refused to offer any compensation for either the day we lost trying to get on flights, the $100's traveling back and forth to the airport or the hotel penalties we incurred when we failed to make it to our destination.  Even a taxi voucher to get us home after the final cancellation would have gone a long way towards making us feel better about the process, but airport staff denied the request.  In addition, although we booked as a family on a single reservation, we were split up because United's system mysteriously bifurcated our original reservation.

We were a little bit behind schedule, but the pilot managed to get us to PR as fast as he could.  I felt safe during the flight. Prior to our take off, we waited for over 40 minutes.  During this wait, I couldn't help to overhear the conversation 2 of the crew members were having in their cabin.  This conversation make me feel VERY anxious, since I am afraid of flying.  The crew member ""Rey"" was telling a co worker about how a Delta flight waited for so long and took off without ""de-icing"" the plane, and apparently, when that happens the plane does not get enough lift, so they crashed.  He then added in a sarcastic tone, ""there were many survivors, like none"".  I obviously felt worried and horrible because we had been waiting for a while and I had no idea if the airplane was properly defrosted or whatever.  The person he was talking to even replied something about him being so negative.  I think this obviously was an innapropiate conversation to be having in front of the passengers or when they can hear you loud and clear.   Also, the food and beverage passed by my seat, and I don't know if it had to do with the fact that I was seating in the last row, but they didn't stop to offer me or my sister who was sitting next to me.   After the cart was put away a very nice crew member offered me something to drink and brought me water.  As I said, the flight itself was good, but the service I thought was extremely disappointing and the crew member was insensitive and unprofessional with his comments.

On top of that, when I called the lost baggage 800 number the bot said that there was ""no information"" on my lost bag, but the person at the baggage claim had indicated that the bag was already loaded onto the next EWR/LAX flight. So we drove for an hour back to the United LAX baggage claim late that evening just to get an update (after trying to get info from the 800# but always getting the ""no info"" feedback). The person at LAX indicated that the flight had been delayed for 4 hours and that was why the bag had not shown up by the time the first person had indicated earlier that day. The 800# is USELESS and FRUSTRATING and WASTES PRECIOUS TIME. And the lost baggage people don't communicate with the people who are routing the lost bags to their proper pick up locations and they're inputing erroneous info into the system (wrong city with no such address).

I was told that if I was concerned about my connection that I should go to customer service, where there was a two hour lineup.  The service on at your desks and on your flights has become rude and downright hostile.  It was sadly so obvious when I transferred to a Swiss Air flight and was treated responsibly and respectfully.  There are no protections for the passengers flying on the US airlines and you clearly are taking advantage of that.  If this had been a European airline, I would have been responsibly compensated for the delays.  All I saw from United was unbelievable arrogance and rudeness and 15 Swiss Francs.  After I complained you offered me a $100 coupon - for stretching a trip EWR - BCN to 30 hours!!  And, then checking area was madness.  All I had to do was drop a bag as I was fully checkin in and I had to wait in lines for 45 minutes.

At least that way you would know that the crew acknowledged the inconvenience and was trying to make the best of it.  When you are forced to sit and get no update all you get is mad.  This happens frequently at O'Hare.  I travel frequently and assume you decide to take off and land knowing there is n gate ready so you can announce an on time arrival.

I realize I bought a basic economy ticket and should have read all the fine print.  My son did not fly out with us to Detroit.  On reaching the ticket desk, I mentioned this to the agent and was told to not check him in and he would still have a seat back. Then, when I went to check us in for our return, Sean did not have a ticket – even though I was told he would when we left Newark.  I called customer support and was told I did not have a ticket, since he did not fly out and that was considered a change.  The reps told me the agent at the desk was not correct and I had to buy a one way ticket for $173. Reason I was not happy with United and will definitely consider not flying with United again unless absolutely necessary >I was told by a United employee that all I had to do is not check him in and he will have a ticket back.  I realize I did not read all the fine print, but I would expect a United employee to give me the correct answer.  That expectation was incorrect.  And as I told the customer service rep, it should not be a customer’s job to know United employees responsibilities.  If that agent did not have the right answer, she should have told me to ask another United person or call a rep – NOT give me an incorrect answer.  If I had known he did not have a ticket, I would have had him go home with the people he went out with. >If my ticket gets cancelled, I would expect at least an email that my ticket is cancelled.  Because Sean was a no show, my ticket was cancelled.  I heard nothing from United with that information.  It should be part of the system to notify a customer when the ticket is cancelled. >In my naivety, I did not consider this a change.  I considered it – me paying for something I did not use (the flight to Detroit). >Lastly, the customer service reps were very confrontation and not helpful.  One rep – Millie – even questioned my parenting skills and how I could let my 14 year go to Detroit with another family.  She also asked how a 14 could drive – which was ridiculous.  These comments caused the conversation to escalate to a point where I said things I actually apologized for.  I will not have a customer service rep question my parenting or any behavior.  That is ridiculous and very poor customer service.  Also, I asked to speak to her supervisor and Millie told me she did not have one.    Until I refused to talk further and asked many more times, did she transfer me to another representative.  Given the environment and travel being a price driven market, I would think United would have better customer service and treat customers properly.

Departure flight - Jan 9. 2018 1. over an hour delay sitting on the runway with no offerings of food or beverage.  The delay was a result of issues with the plane.  The fact that no one came with offerings of food or beverage for an 8am flight led to severe discomfort and turned our 11.5 hour experience to beyond 13 hours.  2. When the plane did finally take off, we were told there was no Wifi.  This led to failure of being logged on to work on the flight and resulted in delays in my workload.  3. FREEZING temperatures on the BOTH the departure and return flight.  The departure flight to Newark was on Jan 15th, and an OVERNIGHT flight.  The freezing temperatures on the flight kept us up the entire flight and when we asked if there was anything that can be done, the response was simply no.  We would have expected that the attendants be willing to accommodate even in the form of offering us another blanket. However, that was not the case.  The point of the overnight flight was to be able to sleep as both Jason and I had work the morning we landed.    Jason and I kindly request that you review the above concerns and reach out to us to discuss further.  We request that this gets escalated to management and reviewed accordingly.  we can be reached at 347.228.8860 for further discussions.  Your truly, Jason Gardner & Alicia Ramnarine",Negative,-0.9081

We were first made to board one plane, and then asked to deplane due to maintenance issue. We were then told another aircraft was ready in the gate next door. Turns out, this aircraft had a maintenance issue too (which we found out only close to an hour later). Finally, the third aircraft we were put on was to arrive an hour later than this. The fact that two consecutive aircrafts we were supposed to board were both suffering from maintenance issues is quite disturbing. Also, when there is a delay, information must be provided to customers on the expected delay time. Instead, the screen at the gate/information in the app keeps adding 10 minutes at a time to the delay, which is not informative at all. Since we do not know how long the delay actually is, we cannot go to the lounge or elsewhere and are forced to hang around in the crowded gate. The lack of information to passengers is very  dissatisfying. In particular, once we were made to deplane from our first aircraft and waiting for the second aircraft, the gate agent disappeared down the air-bridge for almost 30 minutes leaving the passengers stranded with no updates -- and this is after we were lead to believe we would be boarding immediately. This is highly unprofessional. The gate agent cannot just disappear in order to avoid giving information to passengers waiting at the gate for a delayed flight. This is just unacceptable. Also, in general you really need to improve your on-time performance for flights to smaller airports. Out of 4 flights in my entire trip this time, 3 of them were delayed and only 1 was on time. This flight was delayed 3.5 hours, and my flight from Chicago to Champaign on 12th Jan was delayed 16 hours leading me to have to spend the night at Chicago. The fact that 75% of the flights in my itinerary were delayed, and only 25% of the flights left on time is a serious problem -- in my eyes, this is a failing grade.

There was a large group that flew together from a company called Wework. They were all loud and I understand that can happen. However there were two gentlemen in back of me that were loud the entire flight and at least 25% of their language was foul and unacceptable. While I was not particularly fond of it being yelled in my ear throughout the first four hours of the flight, the two young girls (approximately 10 and 7) sitting across the aisle should not have been exposed to it. My wife, watching a movie with headphones on, was not able to hear the movie several times from these two gentlemen who were swearing just about every minute of the four hours when they were somehow defeated in their mobile video game they were playing. In speaking with the dad of these two girls after the flight, his concern was the same as mine. If we had addressed the issue with either the gentlemen themselves or called attention to their behavior to a flight attendant, we would have probably been targeted not just by the two gentlemen, but the other 10 to 12 people they were flying with. We had both decided that we would suffer through it in order to not create an incident which would further an already negative experience. However, their behavior was so consistent and ongoing, that there was no way that at least one of the flight attendants wouldn't have heard it. At that point, I would have hoped that they would have directed the gentlemen to control their behavior in a manner that was more appropriate for an airline flight with families on board.",Negative,-0.9457

It took them over 20 minutes to retrieve after multiple passengers, including myself, asked for oxygen and if there was an AED on board. It just seems like they were ill prepared for this type of situation. I am doubtful your attendant survived and sad if such a loss occurred. He was on a few other flights and I saw him go over and beyond to interact and engage with kids on an Orlando flight just a week earlier.

It wasn't very cold AND if people think it's cold they should check their bags. Many of us do not want to wait at baggage for our bags. That was the first problem. The second problem is that we waited 50 minutes for our bags at baggage. It was a very unhappy experience.   One additional problem:  when we left O'Hare there was a delay and while we pushed back from the gate early we sat on the tarmac about 10 feet from the gate for about 15 minutes with no update from the flight deck.

Given that there was no one who was going to pay for that seat obviously, there was NO reason for me to have to sit back in the other seats.

This delay caused us to miss a connection and re-orient our entire trip. This was especially inconvenient given that the flight time from the west coast to the east coast is already a long flight.    We received no advance notice of this delay via text or email. When we asked the agent to check on other flights to see if we could make our original connection in Chicago we got an annoyed look and were told that we were being rude.  Nothing like ""I realize your frustrated, and I'll try to see what I can find."" It was not the best customer experience.    After this we put two large bags on the scale (in succession, one at at time). They were each 1 lb. overweight. The agent insisted we remove items and take them in our carry-on to get each bag to 50 pounds.  I realize this is a policy, but these bags were not 55+ pounds and on other occasions with United (and other airlines) a bag within one pound of the limit was deemed acceptable.    Once on the plane, the pilot informed us that there would be a 45 minute delay because of crowded airspace at Newark and we'd be waiting on the tarmac.  This delay, which I realize is not in United's control, nonetheless jeopardized making our connection in Newark to our final destination in Albany.  (Fortunately we were able to make the connection.)     All in all it was a sour trip, from the delay which we were not notified about, and the ultra-picky bag weight experience, and further delay on the tarmac, it soured the whole trip.",Negative,-0.95

On a flight I took with United last week I was also required to check my bag because when the ticket attendant asked me to make sure that it fit according to the spaces made for checking before entering the plane it was not able to fit, so I had to check it, understandably. Based on my previous experience, I made sure to travel with a smaller bag that would definitely fit for this trip. I would have expected this to be the typical way that things are handled, however, based on this experience, it is not, as there were many bags bigger that did not have to be checked.

I’m sitting in seat 30D next two a mother/father and 22-month old child.  The father was sitting next to me with the baby on his lap and he says – I have to apologize up-front as my child has an ear ache and he screamed most of the last flight. As the plane begins to move away from the gate the baby starts to wail and upon take-off his screams of agony can be heard through the entire plane.  The screaming last for quite some time and I would often let the father out to walk up/down the aisle to try and conform the child.   I don’t fault the child or parents.  I’m a father of 3 and I know how difficult it can be to travel with children.  But what happened next was inexcusable.  About 45 minutes into the flight I got up to let the father out and I noticed that there was an open seat toward the front of the plane.  The mother/father wanted to lay their child down and I offered to move seats to accommodate.  I brought it up to the flight attendant – Who responded:  No, I’m sorry.  That seat is economy plus and you paid for an economy seat.  And I was told I could NOT move…unless I wanted to pay for an upgrade.  Wait…what?!?!  I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.  Nor could the passengers around me.  For some reason, the flight attendant thought that the airline would lose money – or perhaps she thought she would lose her job – if I was allowed to move to this seat.  The baby continued to scream…and scream.. and only subsided for a very short while on 3+ hour flight.  In short, the baby screamed the entire flight.    What exactly do you think economy plus is anyway?  It’s the same seat with slightly more leg room.  I wasn’t asking to move to 1st class…just a different seat to help accommodate the parents, baby and I….not to mention all of the other passengers that were forced to endure the situation.  I ended moving asking some folks to shift economy seats and move a few rows ahead.  This further irrigated those that were asked to move.  United boasts about exceptional customer experience – and being all about the passenger and flight experience.  United – You failed at the expense of several passengers.  And why – because you lost sight of passenger(s) satisfaction over the incorrectly perceived notation about cost and/or airline process.  To rub a little salt in the wound – I stopped by the united customer service desk on my way out and relayed my disappointment in a very kind and courteous manner.  They couldn’t have cared less and told me to call united when I got home.  I have no doubt that I will receive some form of automated message in response to this complaint.  And maybe a coupon for a future flight.  Unfortunately – I have already booked several additional united flights for me and my family.  Once completed, you can rest assured knowing that I will not fly United as long as I have an option.  You can go ahead and close my account, my mileage plus account and flush your points down the drain.  I plan on sharing my story to all who will listen.  You failed United.",Negative,-0.9172

The 800# call center people and the gate agents are fine. They do their job and put up with us disgruntled travelers just fine. I pity them and the crap you put them through. But that you so rarely deliver on the simple promise of delivery people to a destination in the time YOU claim you can, is shocking. Actually it isn't shocking. And that's sad.

F FA did nothing to make sure seat backs were in the full upright position before take-off.  Pax in front of me was reclined throughout take-off.  Direct TV ran the promo trailer video four times through take-off and leveling off.  Take off was around 7:30pm, Direct TV programming not available until 8:10pm.

F FA told me I had a choice of Chicken Tandoori or a Snack Box.  This is a flight that is nearly three hours.  I didn’t get dinner at ORD because you advertised it as a dinner flight in F.  I guess because I am a 1K the FA “gifted” me the chicken tandoori.  My seat (4E, 737-800) would not stay in the upright position.  I had a lot of work to do and needed to type.  I cannot type in the recline position.  I re-adjusted my seat countless times during the flight.  The toilet seat would not remain in the up position for a male to urinate.  Ugh.

My 2 year old was sick and uncomfortable and had finally fallen asleep in my lap. In order not to disturb her, I was sitting with my knee and foot slightly in the aisle. Passengers had no trouble passing, the service cart had no trouble passing, and other flight attendants did not mention any issue. Others on the flight had their toes just as far in aisle. Gazella addressed me rudely twice, asking me to move my foot. I did my best without waking my baby. Again, my foot was only sticking out a couple of inches. Gazella then walked by my seat and stepped directly, slowly on my foot, hard. She was wearing black clogs. She did not acknowledge that she had done this. I was shocked by this action, so on her next walk down the aisle, I asked for her name. I have photo of exactly how I was sitting for reference.  I understand that for safety reasons we need to have the aisle clear, and that a reminder of this rule would be well within the rights of any crew member. What is unacceptable is the obvious intention to cause physical injury as a way of making a point. There were 2 others who witnessed this action and were just as shocked as I was. This issue was in addition to United losing one of our suitcases for 6 days. This has been reported separately.  I have already submitted a feedback form online and will be following up with United by phone and by mail to the Grand Plaza Drive address in Texas. I will additionally be sending letters to the United corporate offices, to Oscar Munoz (CEO), Scott Kirby (President), Robert Milton (Chairman) and Andrew Levy (CFO).",Negative,-0.8965

There were other spaces too.  Waiting for the baggage caused me to be stuck at the airport another 40 minutes, and my kid was waiting for me to come home and feed him.

The gate agent working this flight was awful.  The flight was delayed repeatedly for a maintenance issue, ultimately departing about 90 minutes late.  The delay grew in 10 to 20 minute increments until it was about 50 minutes late, then a decision was made to provide an alternate aircraft, which was going to arrive a few minutes later at an adjacent gate.  The gate agent was largely absent from the gate area after the original boarding time, occasionally returning to make announcements as the delay extended.  Once a decision was made to provide an alternate aircraft, and that the delay would extend to about 90 minutes, I learned this from checking the status on the United app; the agent did not make a timely announcement.  The most infuriating part of this delay came when we were finally boarding the alternate aircraft.  The agent began boarding with the customary pre-boarding for families with small children, uniformed military, and Global Services members.  Several folks boarded.  At this time the agent became distracted, engaging in what appeared to be a casual conversation with another gate agent.  We waited at least two minutes through this conversation, when clearly boarding could have continued, before passengers just got frustrated and approached the gate to board.  He then realized that perhaps he should continue boarding folks on this flight that was already delayed 90 minutes, and called for Group 1 to board.  This agent displayed a complete disregard for the frustration of the passengers who had to endure this 90-minute delay.  We wanted to board and get on the flight to get going, and he needlessly delayed the boarding while he was engaged in what clearly was not an urgent conversation related to the flight he was working.  I was very unhappy.  I have considered sharing this event in a separate note to the United 1K voice department, but I hope you can pass this information on to the correct supervisor so this gate agent is counseled on his behavior.  Delays happen; that is a fact of air travel.  But agents should at least be attentive to the passengers, and sensitive to the frustration of the passengers who endure the delay.  This agent definitely was not.",Negative,-0.6473

It took several agents to resolve and no one was able to explain who authorized the change in my record and said it should never have occurred.  I used close to 1 million mikes for this trip and expect better service.  Had I not been diligent about checking my reservation, they would have had no seat assignments prior to arrival and this took me several days and hours to resolve.  Upon returning from Rome, one of my bags which was supposed to have priority handling did not arrive.  An agent called to confirm that my bag was on flight 41 on Wednesday, Jan 3 and would be delivered to my home.  I received a call late in the evening indicating the bag did not arrive and would not be delivered.  I have talked to several agents at the priority baggage desk since that time and no one can confirm where the bag is because the tag had been scanned previously.

To your lazy and overpriveleged cabin crew, I have only one question: If you resent the passenger call button, what are you doing working in a service industry?

That way people would know to bring headphones and would be able to download the app over Wi-Fi. (2) That's peanuts, though. By far the biggest problem, and the reason I would not recommend United at this point, was the check-in experience. I was on a Basic Economy ticket, so I could not check-in online. I was on a very last minute ticket, flying down to Florida to visit a critically ill grandparent. I needed assistance at the airport (quickly approve my luggage, see if I could switch to PBI to meet another cousin who was flying in) and there was NO ONE to help me. Every single person I asked redirected me to a different desk. No one took ownership of the problem, and I was very pressed for time, and running around in circles trying to get help. It was just a terrible experience. Then when I got to the gate, there was a long line, because boarding was delayed. I couldn't get anywhere near the gate to speak to the flight attendants, so I asked the attendant at the gate next door (who was just standing there not doing anything) if she thought I had time to go to the restroom (per her vast experience and likely ability to just the length of a boarding line). Rather than say ""looks like 10 minutes but maybe don't take the chance"" or ""well what time is the flight"" she actually barked at me that this was not her gate and she can't help.

When i got on board i was not offered an amenity kit but everyone else was. Even after i requested for one 2. During the pre-meal beverage service, i asked for sparkling water. The flight attendent used her hands to put ice in the glass. She then poured sparkling water which didnt fill half the cup. This made her go back to get more. She brought back a glass full of clear liquid  then filled it with more sparkling water. I soon drank it and it was alcohol! Keep in mind i am underage and it was overall unsanitary. I called her back and she just took the drink with no apology and later no replacement was brought. 3. The meal i got wasnt my first choice which was given with no apology or explanation on why i didnt get my first choice. In addition my utensils were dirty so i pushed the call button and waited but no one ever came. When i finally got the attention of one flight attendent she rudely told me to hold on . When she finally came to me, I told her about the dirty utensils and she abruptly took them away from me and gave me another set by tossing it on my tray with no apologies. 4. After finishing my meal, the flight attendent took my tray but rudely took my unfinished drink on my tray and slammed it on my table. I placed drink on tray because i was finished with it. She walked away without an apology. 5. While waiting a lengthy time for dessert, lights were turned off as if the service was completed. After 20 mins it was eventually turned on and dessert cart came out. 6. When i was offered dessert, i was yelled at. When i replied she yelled back ""what"". The ice cream was rock hard and my original brownie was dropped on floor. Flight attendent replaced the brownie but no apologies were given. 7. Throughtout the flight numerous service items were dropped on the floor by flight attendents.   Overall flight attendents had bad attitudes and showed poor customer service. I am very upset because in the end no apologies were given to me by any of the flight attendents. Instead i felt unappreciated the whole flight. This was my first flight where i was very dissatisfied. I hope these issues will be reviewed and addressed. Thank you for having the time to read this.",Negative,-0.9877

There was no space for the lines of the groups and the people. 2) When we arrived to Buenos Aires Airport, Ezeiza, it was a strike of porters. Sure this isn´t a United responsability but I think United need to know how to move with this problem. Perhaps this problem happens one, twice or ten times per year in Argentina, but the people who was waiting the luggage, in that area can´t buy water or something to eat. We were waiting 5 hours to finally get our luggage, so I recommend for the future an active position from United. I´m Argentinian and I understand some things, but it were american people who came to Argentina to get a Princess Cruise, and they were 75 years old.

After calling about this I got many text messages saying my flights had been cancelled. I sat on hold for 30 min while they tried to see why they were cancelled, uncancelled, recancancelled and uncancelled again!! I was forced to totally repack everything hrs before my flight! Upon boarding for my flight, I need extra time due to disabilities. I was asked by the gate attendant ""Are you really disabled?"" What!? Because I couldn't take my cane D/T to the no carry on rule, I am questioned about my disability! I can barely walk, have a hard time with balance and getting up and down. I have lymph edema, neuorapathy, Diabetes, asthma, and cancer! As an RN (Retired Now) I was horrified by the whole ordeal!",Negative,-0.9488

Once we cleared customs and were forced to wait 15-20 minutes for our checked bags to arrive, United agents showed up with hotel vouchers and tickets for an afternoon flight the following day for some members of our group.  For some reason they didn't have anything for my husband and I and the first agent I spoke to was rude and unwilling to investigate or remedy the situation.  A second agent I spoke to later returned with the tickets and a hotel voucher for a hotel different than the others in our group.  Our traveling group of 8 immediately informed the agents (on both sides of the customs gate) that we were not interested in the following day's flight or the hotel vouchers.  Due to family illnesses and other scheduling issues we were not willing to be delayed by the 15+ hours.  We needed to get home as soon as possible and were willing to drive the 3 hours instead of waiting until the following afternoon.  Even though two rental vehicles were going to cost less than the hotel vouchers, no United agent wanted to listen to our requests and offered to do nothing else for us.  Their response of ""there's nothing I can do"" and you'll have to go to United's website"" were not appropriate answers to give passengers stranded at an airport late in the evening who were willing to offer United an alternative, lower cost solution to the problem.

If we had been notified earlier we could have come to the airport later, not gone through security and or had more options.

Had to take a train to the terminal.  Going through TSA was fairly easy but then I had to go down starts walk a 1/2 mile then go up stairs and my gate was all the way at the end.  My asthma was getting bad literally had to ask a young lady pushing a empty wheel chair for assistance and she tanned to the gate which was a minute pass the boarding cut off but they still had the door open and let me on.  At that point I was having a full blown asthma attack.  But everyone was so assisting especially the flight attendants they came off the plane and ask if I need water and said they can get me a straightback wheel chair to board me.  I explained I just needed to use my inhaler and sit for a bit and my asthma attack would decline.  I was allowed to sit in a exit row and mild air a flight attendant checked on me.  They was very attentive the entire flight especially the older lady of them all.  I felt like if something was going to happen they wasn't going to let it.

My flight was scheduled to depart at 2:20pm. I checked my bags and paid $25 for my first checked bag and $35 for my second checked bag. They were each under the 50 pound limit. My fellow passengers and I boarded Flight UA745 but we never left the ground because of ""break problems."" Long story short, passengers were told to deboard and meet with customer service to arrange alternative transortation on a different flight. Because there were no flights at La Guardia going to my destination United Airlines customer service ended up shuttling me to Newark Airport. That same day, I checked into flight UA506 at Newark Airport. This is when things started to really become aggravating and extremely frustrating for me. When United Airlines weighed my same two bags at Newark Airport they suddendly became more than 3 pounds each OVERWEIGHT. I had no added ANYTHING AT ALL to my bags before weighing them at Newark. Not only had my flight been delayed ans I was going to have to stay overnight in San Francisco in order to make my connection to Redmond Oregon the next day but now I was repeatedly being told by a United Airlines representative that I had added to the weight of both of my suitcases on the trip inbetween La Guardia and Newark Airports!!!! He also repeatedly said that I would have to pay $200 for my suddenly overweight luggages. I didnt have any problems in La Guardia checking in my bags but so much trouble in Newark. While I was still at the counter protesting against this United Airlines representatives demands, I called United Airlines customer service and spoke to a supervisor. She said she agreed with me and in order not to miss my flight she instructed me to transfer all of my ""overweight"" items into a single suitcase and be charged one overweight fee instead of two. She also told me to file a complaint about this as soon as you can and you will be reimbursed for the $100 excess weight fee.  After this experience  I wasnt happy at all and vow to never fly United Airlines again until this situation is handled properly",Negative,-0.9807

The flight was not full so I carefully chose my seat which had empty seats at least one in advance.  However, during a long annoying wait (1.5 hours) on the ground at EWR (in order to unload wrongly loaded luggage) , one couple who were originally seated at 28 EF insisted to sit next to me (28 AB).  As I didn't want those seats taken by them (that means no single extra seat to stretch out while most of other seats in that area had), I asked them to try others.  I would say yes to them, if I was asked to give up only one out of those two empty seats, but they demanded VERY aggressively as they HAD to sit together next to the window, so I HAD to give those seats for them.  I resisted for a while but I gave up arguing with such rude people and tried to find a better seat myself.  Luckily, I found 22BC empty so I moved to 22C, after agreeing with a passenger at 22A.    After a while, I learnt that 28EF were not 'Economy Plus' but normal 'Economy' seats, I reported to one of the cabin crew that they were not entitled to move to those seat (28 AB), without paying extra for upgrade.  She (Japanese lady) promised to work on it, but I am not sure if she ever spoke to that rude couple and they paid the extra for 'Economy Plus'.

My wife and I arrived before the recommended 2 hours ahead of the scheduled departure in order to be sure to turn in our rental car on time and get to our gate without any rush and stress. It seems to me that UA must have known even then (about 10:15 a.m. or so) that they had plane issues which were going to greatly delay our planned 12:26 p.m. departure for Chicago from Miami.  Yet, the sign boards for scheduled departures showed our flight as being ON TIME.  Then, as we started approaching an hour before the scheduled departure time of 12:26 p.m., the sign boards indicated that the flight was now delayed (no reason given) for an additional 45 minutes or so.  A while later that initial delay was extended to be more like an hour plus.  Finally, as we  got well past our originally scheduled departure time and into the delay, the sign board was once again updated to indicate that the flight would be just about 2 hours delayed.  It wasn't until then that the gate check-in crew announced to the crowd that there were mechanical safety issues with the inbound flight and that was the reason for our delay.  Our flight crew (captains and attendants) all arrived right about the time the inbound flight finally arrived at our gate.  That was shortly after the Miami gate folks had arranged for free snacks and drinks to be distributed to all the waiting passengers (this was about 1 1/4 hours after our originally scheduled departure and about 2 3/4 hours after my wife and I had first arrived at the gate).  The captain introduced himself to the crowd over the loud speaker at that time and explained that the airline had faulty equipment which needed to be swapped out for a working airplane that could safely get us back to Chicago.  I realize that unforeseen things can go wrong.  I know that planes need to be maintained and that there will be problems arising from time to time.  There is no reason, however, for the overly long wait to communicate to all your UA passengers what is the problem and when it is going to be fixed.  The ON TIME message should have been changed at least one to two hours before it actually was.  The inbound flight information should have been conveyed to those of us who were waiting at the gate.  I strongly feel that the airline should reimburse us for some portion of the cost of our ticket.  We met our end of the bargain - we were there over two hours ahead of the scheduled departure time and ready to go.  The airline failed to live up to its commitment, however, and we were late in getting to our destination by a significant amount of time.  Flying down to Miami, we took Frontier Airlines.  We left our O'Hare gate right on schedule and landed ahead of the ETA in Miami by about 15 minutes.  United should do better.  We paid for a higher level of service and yet we received a worse ride for our money than on the trip down to Florida on a ""low cost"" airline that you compete with.  I am very disappointed with our experience on your airline and will think long and hard about booking any future flights with UA (even though we have been long-time Mileage Plus members and generally work to maximize our points under your frequent flyer program).  I feel sad for the low level of perfo",Negative,-0.9309

It's almost always 25 to 30 minutes now.  There is no sense of urgency and it seems to me they do their best to actually slow it down.  Are there standards that should be met and if so is anyone monitoring those standards?  Newark Terminal A is such a disaster in so many ways and this does not make it any more appealing.  The TSA Pre line is rarely opened on the way in and the existing setup without Pre is very inefficient and time consuming.   It's an extra 45 to 60 to get in and then I have to wait 30 + for my bag on the way out because there is no adult supervision and accountability of the ground crew.  JFK and LGA are close to my house and Delta is an option that I have started to think about.,Negative,-0.5106

She even went so far as to tell my children (because I was one of the ones complaining), that she feels sorry for them having me as their father.  I very much OBJECT to that.  That is uncalled for, disrespectful and quite rude.  Shameful to say the least.  She then went on to say things to other passengers and their children that I could not overhear. I ama General Counsel of a prominanet company and I have always carried myself with dignity and respect.  My comment to her was appropriate and professional to voice our objection that we stood on line for over an hour in the heat patiently waiting our turn and she jumped the security rope and forced the ticket agent to take her first.

At the gate, I was the first person to board the aircraft after the gate agent made the announcement that no expanded carry-on rollerboards would be allowed on the aircraft. I was targeted by the gate agent for having a bag too large for the plane and was made to check my bag. Bear in mind, I have flown with this bag on all United aircraft for the past 6 years (as a Global Services member three years in a row and 1K each year before that). I fly A LOT. This bag was not expanded and would certainly fit in the overheads of this A320 as it has for years and years. On top of this insult, I saw many people board the plane after me with bags that would not fit in the overheads. I was irate. Secondly, during the food and beverage service (I was in economy) the flight attendant was extremely rude to me and told me I needed to order a certain way - instead of telling her I was GS at the end of my order and showing her my boarding pass, she condescendingly told me I needed to tell her first that I was GS. This makes no sense - she would look me up at either point either way and should not matter one way or another. She then insisted I was in the wrong seat because she had trouble locating me in her device. Turns out I was in the right seat after all. Surprise. I also saw her treating other passengers with flagrant disrespect bordering on derision. It was appalling. And to make it even worse, she was training a new flight attendant.

Many of us had to work the next day and were trying to get home and did not appreciate being delayed an hour for a few passengers.  When I read the note from Oscar Munoz in Hemispheres that you're trying to improve customer service, this is not an example of that.  If this keeps happening on a regular basis, I will choose another airline to fly.  There are lots of choices out there in case you guys hadn't noticed...",Negative,-0.8328

I was in the middle of the plane but was one of the last people on because everyone was up way before the employer called anyone's number.  2.I made a point to pack lightly, I paid extra for reg. over head. Before enter the air craft it was told that there was no more over head so that anyone moving forward had to have there luggage (over head) checked... and that it would not be available back in Newark outside the door but would have to be picked up and the luggage claim. When I got on the plane- there was plenty of room in the over head luggage compartment. This was so frustrated. The employer checking our boarding pass before entering the aircraft- was rude/nasty.

Then after that the passenger was then allowed to board the plane again.   Isn’t it a breach of security to take a passenger off of the plane after boarding and then let her back on?

I travel very often from stl and I’m aware of the frequent delays in outbound flights. As a workaround I always book my flights on the earliest schedule (Normaly Newark) so I can have Houston Washington and Chicago as a fallback plan. I travel most of the time to GRU. This time in my first attempt on the 21, I couldn’t board the Newark flight because of a delay due to a broken restroom. (Technical problem) then I called global services and was shifted to a flight to Chicago, which got delayed and I was moved to a2o Chicago flight that also got delayed and I lost my flight to Brazil. Because of that I had to cancel a very important business meeting , which I’m still assessing the damage of not being there but it certainly is a blow in my career. When trying to retrieve my luggage took almost 2hs for the baggage team find out thAt they were on their way to Newark on the plain that I didn’t board. Paid for a cab to bring me home and an night at the hotel due to no show....it was less then 24hs before my Check-in so they are entitled to charge. The next they I was bound to Newark again , it was on time I boarde the aircraft and was ready to leave when the stewardess told us to debark due to some delays...called global services and they moved me to a Washington flight...when I went to the gate for the Washington flight, the attendant at the gate told me that this was also delayed and they would put me into an aircanada flight...while he was finishing up my details for the transfer the gate agent for the original Newark’ flight said that they would not be extremely delayed and I could go back to that plan. Nevertheless no one could effectively tell me where my baggage was. In Newark the GS agent couldn’t be sure if my bags where on the plane or not...but a representative in SAO Paulo would expect me at the gate to let me know if the bags were on the flight or not...no one came and I only got certain they were there after waiting in the conveyor belt.

Passengers and I could all hear the aircraft squeaks and other sounds repeatedly. The most noise came from when wheels were being lifted for take off and released for landing which sounded like something braking or already broken. The sounds from the wings engaging for takeoff and landing were unbearable as well. Myself and the passengers around were skeptical and some were frightened by the loud sounds and were unsure if this flight was safe. The worst experience began after landing in DC and attempting to retrieve my belongings as well as my colleagues who had checked baggage as well. When we arrived to the baggage claim area the conveyor belt with the luggage stopped after about a minute or two in which we waited for our luggage and then we were approached by an individual you told us we could retrieve our luggage from the United room in the corner. We all lined up as well as other passengers whose luggage did not show up either and then we all were told our luggage didn't make it to DC but we had the opportunity to pick it up in the AM from the airport or the luggage could be delivered to us. We all chose the delivery option as none of us lived near the airport and had to report to work in the morning. What angered me and everyone else in the line with this situation is that the flight was not even at full to capacity and it did't make sense that so many of our luggage was not there when we needed it. Me and my colleagues were very disappointed as the other flights were no issue until we returned home with thoughts of returning back to work Tuesday only to discover none of our checked bags did not reach the destination we paid for.

My carryon bag is essentially a laptop bag that can hold one days worth of clothes. I’ve traveled all over the world with it as a carry on.  The security person at O’Hare was telling me it would not fit in the cabin overhead space.  Your “test” space has obviously changed so that you can force more people to check a bag and charge them.  I took out a book and some work papers from the from the front pocket and showed them it would fit in your tiny test space.  The ridiculousness of this experience was unnecessary. I had already dealt with a weather cancellation and rebooking and I was already going to be late to my meeting - adding unnecessary time/frustration to the security process just made a bad day worse.  If United is so cheap that you are now forcing carryon bags to be checked, that is appalling.  Additionally, the fact that you only have 1 TSA precheck line at the very end of the terminal with poor signage is also appalling for a large airline, who’s hub is at OHare. I started through security before I was told it was not precheck and had to go out and go back down to the entire other end of the terminal to go back through security.  I paid for tsa precheck and expect to use it whenever I travel for its convenience.  This experience reminded me why I fly Southwest instead whenever possible.

I came up to the attendant at the gate and they didn't seem to know anything. I went to a cafe around the corner to get some food and wait. I came back 20 minutes later to check and spoke with the gate attendant again. She indignantly waved me off and said that she still didn't have a plane and that boarding couldn't possibly begin until 9:15pm at the very earliest. I went back to the cafe to eat and do some work. I came back at 9:17, knowing that since I was in the last boarding group, there was no way I could have boarded any sooner. I came up to the gate attendant and she told me that the flight was gone. Gone?! I asked. But you said boarding would not begin before 9:15 at the earliest! She shook her head and said it simply happened earlier and now the flight was gone. With the way she had dismissed me earlier, I was positive that there was lots of time to kill. I was very distraught. This was the last flight that was available to Des Moines that night, and now, even though I was at the gate early I had somehow missed it! I had to make it to my grandmother's funeral the next morning and I was ready to do anything to get there in time. I told the gate attendant this and she once more shook her head, she seemed to make a half-effort to look things up but it was clear she wasn't really going to help me. I called customer service and found a flight to American Airlines (through Boston, I had to drive 3.5 hours to Boston Logan Airport first) to take a flight out at 5am, to Chicago, then to Des Moines. It got me there just 40 minutes before the funeral on Wednesday morning, Jan. 24, 2018. (This was the only possible option, there are not many flights to Des Moines, Iowa.) I was exhausted and just barely was able to see my family at this most difficult time. The communication with that unhelpful, dismissive gate agent, almost completely ruined my chances of being able to be with my family at this critical time. Even though I have been a Mileage Plus Member for a long time (HCF95825) this horrible experience and my entire experience with United Airlines this week is making me consider permanently withdrawing my business from United Airlines. Additionally to this, in the past week, I took 3 other flights with United in order to visit my grandmother on her deathbed. Every single flight was severely delayed, one was so delayed that I had to stay overnight in Chicago. This has caused physical and emotional exhaustion and undue stress during a time that was already filled with great suffering for myself and my family.",Negative,-0.9652

The plane was more than 75% empty with almost all of economy plus open.  I asked the gate representative as she scanned my boarding pass if I could possibly move into an economy plus seat.  She was gracious and polite, explaining that she would love to have helped me, as she was the only person scanning passes, she needed to keep the boarding process moving and then suggested ""speak to the attendant once you board and maybe they can help you"".  When I did asked the attendant, her response was ""The gate attendant didn't tell you that.  I know she didn't say that to you"".  I tried explaining the situation again, and her response escalated, again calling me a liar.  At this point, I didn't feel it was really worth dealing with this person.  A simply and polite answer along the lines of ""Oh, I am sorry she said that to you, I can't move your seat because of (and then explain the policy, etc).  Instead, this person chose to accuse me of lying.  And it was not just being accused of lying, but her dismissive and aggressive tone that shocked me.   When told this story to my coworker that was also on the plane, she instantly said she saw this flight attendant aggressively dismiss requests from other guest as well.  This small interaction was enough to leave a very sour taste in my mouth and question why would I want to ever deal with this lack of basic manners, politeness and customer service again.  I am able to hear that moving seats isn't possible for a variety of reasons.  But being called a liar is not acceptable.  I travel for business often and I have a choice in who I book my travel with.  I generally book United as my preferred airline, often paying a higher fair than your competitors.  But with an experience like this, I'll be more open to booking on other airlines.  I look forward to hearing how you would like to remedy this situation.",Negative,-0.7862

I am still awaiting their response. As you can see from the history of my messages, there has been no acknowledgement to my comments re: dealing with booking on United’s website. Furthermore, my praises were only for Patrick, not to his supervisor nor senior management. If I had received consistent and sufficient satisfactory service from your representatives during my current patronage with United, then I’d have complimented them as well. Not responding in a timely manner (or at all) to my disappointment from both 1K voice and Customer Care (Mr. Johnson) supports my opinion on how this behavior exhibits the lack of respect you have for both your customers and yourselves. What  is the point of having 1K status? I would really appreciate an answer or should I not bother to expect United to accept responsibility.   My recent flight from TAO to YUL (I48EEJ) via ORD and BOS was a disaster. At check-in, my reservation on the connecting flight to ORD/BOS/YUL was CANCELLED and even though I was on-time for boarding at check-in at PEK, I was informed of the cancellation, and then subsequently waited at the gate for 15 minutes as the agents tried to sort it out while passengers boarded. Needless to say, I lost the original confirmed seat and was now seated at the bulkhead. Because of physical discomfort from prolonged watching the IFE screen at a downward angle (limited mobility in my neck), I had no video entertainment for the next 12+ hours. Furthermore, the washrooms were significantly further because I had lost my originally booked seat which created more discomfort since I have stiffness in my hip joints (another reason for booking aisle seating). Then, on the ORD-BOS leg, I was again assigned a further seat and not an aisle but the dreaded window seat, an additional “pain” to struggle to the restroom. So I definitely did not enjoy my flights. Update: As I am writing this feedback, it had dawned on me that maybe the return leg of my trip was cancelled as well. A quick check on my United account confirmed that and now I am on the phone to the 1K desk with Annabel to correct this. Not looking good, United!!!! Well, Annabel has come through and re-booked me, kudos to her! But this shouldn’t have happened in the first place. Why didn’t the Beijing gate agents who told me that my flight was cancelled take the steps then to recover the complete reservation and avoid my referring to this current episode? One step forward, but two steps back. I really don’t need any added stress to my life.    Dear Mr. Johnson (or whoever is actually reading this),    I can only imagine how swamped you are in replying to United Pax since you've failed to acknowledge my frustrations in trying to book a flight on United's website. I also noticed that re: Patrick, you referred to ""their"" supervisor  .... "" .... 'they' can be recognized ... "", so I can only imagine you are using form letters and ""filling in the appropriate blanks."" Your response is embarassingly unprofessional and insincere. Are you really a Team leader? United's  voice mail frequently informs callers that our calls can be recorded for ""quality assurances ;"" is there anyone monitoring Customer Care responses???  United failed to catch your inept response. So far United Customer Care appears to not really care. The",Negative,-0.6631

We experienced a horrible flight with unnecessary risks!  The problems already started at the check-in process because of system failure. We had to wait a long time before groundpersonel decided to start the check-in process manually. When we finally took off, after the delay, the problems got real. After flying approximatly three hours we turned back towards Amsterdam airport. The flightpersonal told us that several crew members had health issues and started becoming ill. Also several passengers on board started becoming ill. The crew then communicated that the airplane had oxygen problems and therefor decided to head all the way back to Amsterdam Airport. We found it strange because at that moment we’re already at Iceland and had to fly about 2 hours back.. In our opinion that is a strange call and a horrible experience for us as customers/passengers.  When we finally landed at Schiphol airport, none of the crew members told us what the intention was. We had to keep seeted and wait in the airplane that had oxygen problems. This also doesn’t make sence at all. Why again take that unnecessary risk to keep us passengers in a possible infected plane. When we got transfered from the plane to the arrival gate there was a lot of fuss. There were only a few members of united airlines and the communication was bad again. There wasn’t one spokesman that stood up and communicated to all the passengers. So all the passengers were scattered around and try to speak to the united airlines groundpersonel, u had to get lucky to be informed.  The groundpersonel also informed us that originally our flight had to be cancelled.  We have a sound fragment of this statement. They were for some reason be adviced not to fly but we still took off. We were shocked when your groundpersonel told us that.  As above mentioned we find several desisions by United airlines strange and trust unworthy. The lack of “safety first” isn’t       something where your originasation should stand for. At the moment we have a lot of questions about the (unnecessary) risks you’ve put us true and there for would like to see some answers.  Next to these questions we’ve made some additional cost/expensives. We had tickets for the basketbal game on Friday the 19th. We had additional costs for beverages. We had to pay an extra day parking costs for our car. We had additional hotel costs in NY, because of the rescheduele. Fortunately, we were able to rescheduele the return flight a day later to be a reasonable time in New York. But we were forced to take an extra day off from our work.  In the end we flew to Frankfurt with Lufthansa on January the 20th, after a stopover we arrived in New York. But also at check-in it was not properly arranged, one of us was registered for the flight the other 3 persons weren’t. During the trip we coudn’t sit together and we were all scattered around the plane. These days weren’t what we had been expected of our holiday to the USA and in particulair to New York. You could mention that this terrible expirience gave us a lot of stress and not the holiday expirience you would normaly have.  We kindly request you to pay the legal standard fine amount of €600 for each person for the more then 4 hour delay, the additional costs incured and looking forward to yo",Negative,-0.9009

Seat 25 F and had to cover my ears at one point- very unpleasant. They bumped up the passenger in the aisle in my row to first class. The woman in the middle seat never moved over into the aisle so we were very cramped. I think the flight attendant should have given her that option (she seemed like an inexperienced traveler who didn't know she could change her seat). The wall next to my seat below the window had old dried food on it (or worse- vomit?)- gross. The Directv screen was very bright and there was no way to turn it off. I was trying to sleep and the bright flickering screen made that impossible. Also the announcement that we are beginning our descent seems to come too early. In the past these were made 10-15 min before landing. Now it is sometimes 30 min or more which is excessive in my opinion. Also I find flight attendants in general are lax about telling passengers to move their seat back to the upright position. it is not enough to announce it- need to walk through the aisles and make sure.

I have traveled extensively throughout Europe using budget airlines almost exclusively, and the basic economy tickets are a combination of all the worst features of those budget airlines -- without the budget price! Some budget airlines in Europe won't allow you anything bigger than a personal item on board. Some make you pay a small ($10) fee for a regular carry-on. I didn't even have that option. My options were to purchase a large suitcase to check, or to bring only a personal item. Given the length of my trip, purchasing a large suitcase to check would have been a ridiculous waste of money and space. However, I struggled to fit everything into my personal item.

As suggested we went early to the airport and spoke with the gate agents who were not able to accommodate us.  They told us that they asked all the people around and no one was willing to move so that we can sit together.  When we got onto the plane the passengers all were very accommodating and were all willing to move and said that they were never asked by the gate agents about moving to accommodate our family sitting together.  The flight attendants would not allow us to sit there because the gate agents already moved our seats to the back and told us that these seats were only for paying customers.  This experience was the worst customer service we have ever received flying with United.  We were very disappointed in how this was handled.  I still have not removed the credit back from the seats that we paid for and never got to use.

It was impossible, literally impossible, for me, needing a wheelchair but no one could have pulled it off, to get from international Newark terminal to the SFO gate in ten minutes. Why did you schedule me that way?  My luggage did not get put on my SFO flight so I had to wait extra hours at SFO airport for my suitcase, which contained my housekeys (a mistake on my part), among other life necessities like my insulin. If you had just routed me on a reasonable timing schedule, no problems. And my suitcase, when it tumbled onto the baggage claim machines in SFO had absolutely no luggage numbers or the ID luggage tag I had paid good money to buy. All identifying info was gone. I was almost a miracle my suitcase ended up in SFO on a later flight. I get putting my luggage on a later flight. I don't understand why you rushed me to Newark when there were several later Newark flights. The only reason I made the Newark flight to SFO was due to truly heroic efforts by the woman pushing my wheelchair:  she screamed all the way to get folks out of our way, I had to walk up a steep long ramp from the airport shuttle which is very painful for me and this was unnecessary for I could have taken a later flight. I could have, for example, taken the next flight that had my suitcase! And what the heck, if I had not opted to wait at SFO for that next flight, how would United have identified my suitcase since your employees removed all identifying tags, including my luggage claim number.  It made for a hellish day that did not have to be hellish. And I volunteered to be rerouted. And no one has offered to pay for me to replace my removed (it was buckled onto my suitcase) luggage ID doohickey tag. I had not eaten that day so I had to, because I am a type one diabetic, buy some of your overpriced and crappy on-plane food -- nothing offered that is good for diabetics, btw.  I had no time in Newark to get water or food. AND. . . AND. . my wifi would not work on the plane. I wanted to buy wifi but your system just wouldn't let me. My brand new Macbook Pro was not the problem. I also was unable to use the free inflight video service:  I just couldn't download the weird plug (I had never heard of it, I keep my machines up to date) to my laptop so I couldn't watch movies or get online. I had planned to get some work done online. The trauma of that absurdly tight scheduling in Newark was bad enough . . but then having to hang around for hours at SFO hoping my suitcase showed up on later flights when I should have been on a later flight.  I will fly United again because I got some vouchers but $800 in vouchers is not enough for the nightmare. You could easily have put me on a later Newark SFO flight and it is your job to keep luggage claim numbers with routing into on my suitcase . . .but you didn't. The whole day was hellish because of the stress I incurred by being stupid enough to volunteer to not take my original flight to Chicago, where, btw, I had plans for my adult daughter to come to O'Hare for a visit during my layover.

I was assured by the representative that this note had been made on my reservation, and was given a bulk head seat to accommodate. The representative assured me that I would be on a window seat, as I made note to her that it would be extremely distracting for the animal to work with people walking by all the time. When I arrived at the HNL airport, I checked in, and was told there was no note on my reservation that I would have an animal with me. I explained that I had done so more than a month ago. The attendant made me wait over an hour to make a phone call and get things confirmed. I had also given my license to the TSA representative, and never got it back, causing further complication. Though I had to carry on without it because I had been so significantly delayed by the animal reservation complication. When I boarded, my seat was on an isle, despite previous reassurance that I had a window. The animal had complications and was less able to do her job as a result, though no major problem happened other than extreme stress and risk.   On my return flight, I moved smoothly through an extremely long security line, and when I approached the gate, notified the service person at the gate desk that I was traveling with a service animal, and needed to make sure I had a bulkhead window seat. She took over an hour, after boarding had already begun, to notify my that a seat change was made, without asking any questions or asking if the change was acceptable. My seat was changed to a window seat in row 38, CLEARLY not a bulk head. After excessive difficultly boarding with the animal, and being unable to fit into the seat with the animal anywhere else besides my lap (meaning I had to spend 10+ hours with a large animal on my lap!!), I attempted to get the attention of an attendant prior to take off, but was ignored and disreagarded. I looked for a way to alert the crew using the standard “call attendant” button usually found, but didn’t find any way to alert for help. After take off, I didn’t see another attendant until drunk/food service began. An older, black with short greying hair, female attendant, wearing a blue jacket approached and asked if I wanted a drink. I requested water, and attempted to hand her a hydro flask, but was denied, as she claimed I could only have one cup. I explained that I would need more for my animal and myself, she said she could give me only one cup more for the animal, and that I could have more when she returned on her next trip. As I was unable to call an attendant, I had to get out of my seat to request more water, traipsing over the polite customer next to me with the animal, causing her and I both discomfort and frustration. I had to do this multiple times, as the drink service only came through three times, with the same rude attendant, as of my knowledge. Anytime I had to use the rest room, I had to ask the guest next to me to stand, let us out, and it was extraordinarily unpleasant. My discomfort had gotten so bad with the animal on my lap that I had to stand repeatedly to alleviate the pain. As this was an extremely long flight, I had given up entirely on being able to be at peace at any point.

Probably 20% of the aircraft claimed they needed extra time — no questions asked.  I try to play by the rules, but have little patience when the rules are so grossly abused. 3) I sat in the First Class bulkhead next to a man who brought on a 65 lb golden retriever service(!!!) dog. The dog was lovely but this was incredibly unfair to me. The poor dog tried but given her size, she took over all the floor space in from of both seats.  I had to constantly check to see where I could rest my feet, not to mention that the dos shed all over my clothes. You dont allow bags on the floor during take off and landing in the bulkhead for safety reason, but it’s ok to have a dog take up all the floor space??  I love dogs, but the “service dog” accommodations are getting out of control.

Then - the son went into the same restroom - and was in there for at least 10 minutes.  I walked to the rear restroom - and came back.  The son was still in there.  I think the flight attendants noticed now - and then the mother came, knocked on the door - the door opened , she said something - and then the door closed.  The kid came out about 2 minutes later.  The flight attendant looked in, and had to flush the toilet. So - I realize that there is nothing United can do about stupid, clueless passengers. My major complaint is the fact that this kid was waiting - where he is not supposed to be waiting. I don't care that he was only about 10 - or if it's an 80 year old.

Having said that, we had truly one of the worst experiences ever at the gate. Mr Noemio who was checking people in along with another woman(she was wonderful) was beyond rude and verbally aggressive and abusive.  He insisted from the very start that our carry on bag had to be checked because there was no room. It was within the guidelines of size, but was telling us it wasn’t. We were showing him how it fit in the “test” bin. We were being nothing but kind and just trying to understand the reasoning for his anger and actions. We saw other people in front of us walking equal size bags down the jetway. We finally said, can we try and get it on the plane and if not, just gate check it like others do all the time. His response was, “ you think you can be the last few people to board the plane and do what you want”. I was shocked and now furious with his obvious abuse of whatever power he possessed. He printed out a bag tag and wanted our bag. We refused to give it to him and asked for a manager. At that point, the woman who was working alongside, told us to grab our bags and come with her. We got to the plane, boarded and found ample space to put our bags. After doing this, I walked back to the front of the plane because I saw Mr Noemio talking to the flight attendants. I asked if there was a problem. He was now grilling the man that gate checks bags at bottom of the jetway. I informed him that there was ample space for our bags and more. He continued to be extremely obnoxious, to both myself and the man gate checking. When I asked for his name he first refused. I stepped off the plane and had to visually look at his tag. We fly 12-15 times a year and have NEVER experienced anything like this before. Being the last United Airlines employee the customers see before boarding, Mr Noemio is setting a terrible precedent and image of what we think is a wonderful airline. If it’s my company, Mr Noemio is either terminated or working in a department that doesn’t interact with customers. He is damaging your brand.",Negative,-0.9833

She was angry that our group may not have been the military members dependents to which one of her coworkers (an Italian woman who was AWESOME!) said that it was inappropriate to even ask (it IS inappropriate to ask). The angry woman then blurted out, ""What? Are they married or something?"" in a violent and dismissive way.

Unfortunately, 7C was occupied by a mother with two children, one of which had a special needs seat.  We told the flight attendant that they had two passengers with the same seat and it needed to be fixed.  She told us that she needed to speak with the gate agent.  The gate agent arrived and we explained the situation.  We suggested that they put the woman in our seat right in front of us in an unused first class seat (which stayed empty for the entire flight).  She refused and attempted to have me sit apart from my husband.  We again suggested the empty first class seat.  She told me that that was, ""outside of her ability."" At this time everyone else was on the plane.  The gate agent then proceeded to ask every row if the passengers were flying alone so she could move both my husband and myself.  This was frustrating and time consuming.  We were finally relocated to seats further back on the plane.  No one asked me if I had paid extra for the seats in that section. Luckily I had not, but I found it inappropriate and rude for the gate agent to move us back on the plane without considering how much you charge to sit further up in the plane.  The hour and 20 minute flight was fine, but I am appalled by how your staff acted.  There was no reason the older woman, who needed wheelchair assistance when we landed, couldn't have sat two feet in front of the seat she was in.  Your first class on that flight had at least 3 empty seats.  Your gate agent stated that she herself had changed the seats for the mother (who definitely should have been in the bulkhead seats).  I have worked in customer service for many years.  I know that when you mess up you make things right.  In the future I will be looking for my flights elsewhere.  I don't want to fly with people who make mistakes and are unwilling to fix them without inconveniencing and passing the buck onto others.  A faster and better fix would have been to move the displaced lady to first class.  I still ask myself why that suggestion was treated like such a horrible idea.

Because there was equipment clutter at the gate when we arrived, our pilot would not pull in until after ground crew came out to better organize the carts, even though the weather was extremely cold. The ground crew then retaliated and did not unload our checked bags in a timely manner. Without anyone giving an explanation to the passengers waiting for their bags in the baggage claim area, we waited over 50 minutes at baggage claim before the suitcases started coming down the carousel and then the priority tagged bags arrived last. This was poor cooperation and communication between crews. As a result, we missed our connecting flight to Chicago, even though that flight was delayed by 15 minutes and was at a conveniently located gate. This whole fiasco cost us valuable time and inconvenience, plus the cost of a private car trip to LaGuardia to catch another flight to Chicago since everything out of Newark to Chicago was booked for the day and we would have had to stay in a hotel somewhere overnight. Shame on United personnel. We know the conditions were extremely cold but there was little consideration given to the needs of you intransit passengers. There were 4 of us traveling together, two of us with Global Services status. When we got to LaGuardia we had to rearrange our suitcases so that our non-status travel companion would not have to pay to check her bag.

The airport was able to get my wife on the upgrade list, but she did not get upgraded.

This is the second flight in a row that was delayed. This was due to the inbound aircraft again being delayed due to mechanical reasons. This caused me to miss my connecting flight UA269 to Denver. While in Lansing I was switched to an American flight from Chicago to Denver but due to the late arrival I missed that flight too. I ran from O’Hare gate B22 to K20 just to miss the door closing by minutes.  And because of the short schedules there were no further flights to Denver. I have tried contacting you previously via social media but was unsuccessful, so I am trying this method. I am in the military and get very few days of leave. Having to spend one of those stuck in Chicago and not with my wife is not acceptable. She lives in Colorado and I live in Hawaii, so as you can see we don’t get to spend much time together. After returning my daughter to her mother in Michigan I expected to return to Colorado and be able to spend my last few days at home with my wife.

Later, I went to the bathroom and had to wait.  Apparently the woman in there was taking a long time. The flight attendant yelled at me for waiting back there and then made an announcement that we should all stay in our seats and twist around to see if the vacant light was on and then we could go to the bathroom, but we should not stand up and walk there if the light wasn’t showing vacant.  So people had to keep checking and then run before someone else got up to go.  I was having some GI discomfort, so telling me I couldn’t get to a toilet unless I kept twisting and checking for it to be vacant was extremely stressful. It was like if you did any misstep, they made an announcement chastising us.  Later the attendant yelled at my husband for having a “computer” out at the end of the flight when it was a tablet.  It was like they were constantly searching for people to be breaking rules.  On the other hand, the family in front of us let their toddlers sit together with no parent and the kids get hitting water bottles against the seats and dropping the armrest up and down, but no words to the parents that their children were being disruptive.

I then had to spend hours on the phone from Ireland to rebook my itinerary, which I was unable to do - I had to change my flight plan on the way home. I was never properly told the reason for the cancellation and it took speaking to a different airline before I was properly able to rebook my flights and find out that United had messed up on their end. I was delayed about an hour then on my flight over. On my return flight, there was another lengthy delay and following that my luggage was left in the US. After having been assured that my luggage would be put on the next flight 23 out of Newark and delivered today (8th January) I was disappointed to find that it was not. I then had to call United on their main line because the dedicated baggage number given was engaged or would not work. I then spent over half an hour on hold, only to be told that my baggage was still in Newark, a fact that I had received no update on. The representative was unable to assure me that there would be continued contact from the airline as to the status of my baggage. Yesterday I was assured my baggage would be here by today, and I received no update to say it would not. It took over an hour just to do this. This is unacceptable - I have to go to work and to university. Not only does the bag contain important notes for my final exams, but I moreover do not have the time to wait around at home for a delivery that may or may not arrive.  The representative did inform me that I would be able to track the bag online, however, when I had tried to do that earlier the website did not provide full information about my bag's location. Furthermore, on calling I had to reinform the company of my email, and bag details, which had been incorrectly registered in the first place. I understand that there are difficulties due to inclement weather at the moment, however some level of better communication and an actual answer to the question of whether or if my bag will arrive rather than a platitude about the difficulty of not having my property would be appreciated. Overall I regret to say that I did not have a good experience of flying with the company - especially given I paid over €1,000 for flights. This is a lot of money for anyone, but particularly a college student. Given the cancelled flights, delay in my flight to Mexico City from O'Hare, lengthy delay from Newark to Dublin, delayed baggage and difficulty in getting any information about the status of that baggage (whose delivery was also delayed) I feel this disappointment is more than understandable.",Negative,-0.9776

But if this is the case - HOW were all the economy plus passengers comfortably seated by the time I boarded? Someone informed me that UA actually boards by status. If this is the case, also, inappropriate! I paid A LOT of money for my ticket. Just because I'm not gold or whatever doesn't allow UA not to let people board. Why should someone who is in row 35C but has status board before me??  JetBlue does NOT allow passengers to put their coats and small bags on top, they must be under their seat. Your staff should do a better job controlling was it being placed on board. I noticed a woman asking another woman if she could move her children's SMALL backpacks and the woman wouldn't. This is ridiculous!  Not only was your gate agent inappropriate with me, UA in a way segregates people due to their class. So, I ended up waiting for my luggage, that came on board with me to Managua and back. I would like a refund on the economy plus seat I purchased, plus an explanation of UA's boarding process. Please understand that these negative experiences make me NOT want to book United. I've tried to let this go, especially being a yogi, but besides the gate agent, checking in my luggage - United did not have a person assigned to the jetway in EWR, which left us on the plane for an additional hour and frozen conveyor belts not allowing us getting our luggage for two hours, getting home at 2:30am was not a great experience.
